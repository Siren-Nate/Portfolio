	<h3>Media Analysis and Critique</h3>
	As a writer, when consuming media I love to challenge myself to understand what makes the story and characters work on a deeper level. The following text is an example; I wrote this near the end of my final paper for a child psychology course, and received a perfect score for it. The assignment was to apply everything we had learned about child psychology to analyze the actions of a child character in a piece of fiction. I chose Six, the protagonist of the game <i>Little Nightmares</i> and deuteragonist of its sequel. This was an interesting and enjoyable challenge, as her series has no dialogue of any kind; I had to focus entirely on her actions rather than her words.</br></br>
	<i>"But what would have impaired Six’s ability to empathize with Mono from the beginning, aside from the stress of the situation? This leads to the final theory: Six is heavily coded as autistic in her actions throughout all installments of the series. Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by extreme aloneness, communication problems, intolerance of any change, and ritualistic behavior. Six demonstrates nearly all of these traits in various ways, though some can only be seen if one knows what to look for and how to read between the lines for them.</br>
	Six is near-constantly alone in every installment other than the second, wherein Mono insists on being nearby to her and befriending her. She rarely seeks out companionship except for in the final installment, and even this is only attempted on a couple occasions. Even when making an effort to befriend other children or the Nomes, she is quick to move on and leave them behind, suggesting that she actually prefers being alone even if it means being in more danger. This is in stark contrast to every other child protagonist in the series, all three of which actively seek alliances and to work together with other children nearby. In addition to this, Six very rarely speaks; the only times in the series she says understandable words are when she’s responding to Mono’s attempts to get her attention. This demonstrates echolalia, the automatic repetition of sounds or words, which is another trait of autism.</br>
	However, Six does not seem intolerant of change. She actually seems to adapt very well to change, persistently working her way through each new environment she finds herself in over the course of the series. This is not a sign against Six being autistic, but rather a sign that she has never had a stable enough situation to cling to as a “norm”. As such, her repetitive and ritualistic behaviors are more subtle, such as performing the same actions of giving Mono a boost and catching him several times over the game, or the fact that her room is full of tally marks she presumably made herself. The closest thing Six has ever had to a norm that she would reject any change to would be the peace that came from being alone with the music box after being imprisoned. In the climax of the game, Six is kept placated by supernatural means to prevent her from even attempting an escape from her new confinement, and by far the biggest most unmistakable set piece is the same music box that Mono found her playing with when they first met. Throughout the confrontation that follows with Mono attempting to save her, Six is violently defensive of the music box as he tries to destroy it, showing behaviors and making vocalizations that are highly characteristic of an autistic “meltdown”. Even after she is returned to normal by it being destroyed, the trauma of the massive change and destruction of her only norm clearly sticks with her, and is the biggest reason why she chose to abandon him in the heat of the moment."</br>
