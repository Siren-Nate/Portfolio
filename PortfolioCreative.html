	<h3>Creative Writing</h3>
	I have been writing fiction, both original and derivative, both solo and collaborative, as a hobby for over half of my current lifespan.
	<p style="text-align:left"><i>“Alone…” The voice rattles all around her, intentionally trying to disorient her. But she knows better. The voice can come from all directions, but the next attack will only come from one. “The prey is alone… no pack… no safety in numbers… no burrow to hide away in…” It chuckles. “That means the prey is dead. Long before its heart even stops beating…”</br>
	This area’s too cramped. It could be hiding behind any of those trees. She needs to get somewhere more open - but what if it has another gun? What if it reclaims its first one?</br>
	“This is the finest moment. The instant that makes it all worth it… the discovery of whether it will fight, flight, or freeze. You fought… and now you freeze.” The thing sounds almost elated at her changing tactics. “What next…? What next…?”</i></p>
	<p style="text-align:right"><i>Watching him un-make the TV like that, she can't help but imagine what it would be like if she and him got into a fight, now that they both have powers. Why isn't he giving up? Okay, well, she knows why - because he's</i> him. <i>But wouldn't he have given up on getting to that stupid door in the TV if he knew what was behind it? If he knew that it would be putting himself in danger? Why doesn't he realize that staying with her will do the same?</br>
	...Maybe it's because... he's actually right? Maybe she's just not thinking about it the right way? Her head pivots toward the ground, and she hides her face behind her bangs and hood on impulse. It took her until now to realize, but... maybe she's not afraid of her powers. Maybe she's just afraid of herself.</i></p>
	<p style="text-align:left"><i>He just looks at her. Something about his gaze isn't as intense as before, despite his expression not changing. He's accepted that he is a villain, and that that will never change - his villainous traits are what define him as a person. Ambition, charisma, intelligence... all tainted by his innate callousness and cruelty. He feels nothing from anyone's disapproval of him. He stopped caring what others think of him long ago.</br>
	But even he, the most cold-hearted monster of his time, is a bit stumbled by having to grapple with his own daughter agreeing with such sentiments, after he expressed genuine pride in her.
	</i></p>
	<p style="text-align:right"><i>“People will get hurt, when you aren’t experienced enough to know the harm your actions can bring. It’s impossible to learn without making mistakes - and sometimes, those mistakes will be much worse than simply forgetting that you are made of metal, and letting a dog bite you. I made… far worse mistakes, before my new friends changed my mind and showed me a better way of living.” His voice lowers in something like shame, but he doesn’t let it linger. “Knowing that you did something wrong is the only surefire way to avoid doing it in the future.”</i></p>
	<p style="text-align:left"><i>“That’s what it will be like, a century from now, when you are the only one left. You will find other people you care about. That doesn’t mean they will replace the ones you care about now, or that you will forget them, or even that you will stop grieving - but the grief will be balanced by the happy memories of them.”</br>
	She looks away, staring off into space. “...There was a time when… I thought I had lost the two people in the world dearest to me. Including my beloved partner. And before I found out that was not the case, I had to face the reality of living without them. That’s how I realized that you must balance your grief with remembrance of the positive role they played in your life.”</i></p>
	<p style="text-align:right"><i>"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean any of it. I didn't mean to... to hurt everything so much. I just... when I lost you, when I lost all of you, all at once, I just... I thought it was over. I thought I had... ruined everything for myself, as soon as you found out I'm not... her. That I'm not a legendary, incorruptible hero. I was so scared. I was terrified. I pushed away everything else, I was scared it would hurt me more when I lost it, so I decided to do it myself, on my own terms. I thought if I just went back to how everything was, before I... learned to care about people, when everybody either wanted me dead or was under my control by me... everything would just feel right again. Everything would just</i> make sense <i>again. But it never did. I don't want that. I don't want that anymore, I should have never tried to make it happen. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to you. I'm sorry to everybody. I'm so sorry..."</i></p>
